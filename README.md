Welcome to my profile! I'm currently a master student at the Northeastern University majoring in Computer Science. I am also a part-time beauty blogger and "full-time" adventure seeker. I have previously worked at Tatame (an AI Startup on Metaverse) and Bytedance (the parent company of TikTok). I also interned as software engineer intern at Expedia Group and Ansys. I aspire to become a full-stack **👩‍💻 software engineer**. Thanks for visiting and I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minjie-stella-shen/)!
