Welcome to my profile! I'm currently a master student at the Northeastern University majoring in Computer Science. I am also a part-time beauty blogger and "full-time" adventure seeker. I have previously worked at Tatame (an AI Startup on Metaverse) and interned at Bytedance. I am aspired to become a full-stack **👩‍💻 female software engineer**. Thanks for visiting and I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minjie-stella-shen/)!
